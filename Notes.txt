Notes: 
1) On mobile, there is a 'read more' link under design Elements, Front-End, Back-End but not on desktop? Anchor drops maybe?

2) Need links for each of the 'Resources', some don't appear to be public

3) SEO needs?

4) How does contact work?

5) Does the slider grab 'latest' blog posts from the live site?
-- CORS prevents us from loading articles automagically

6) Should icons link to respective technology they represent? NO

7) Should 'Foundation' be caps in all places? Seems like it is a proper noun. (Yes)

8) Fonts, kerning, leading
-- Leading different in spots on mobile like under DE/FE/BE
-- Still waiting on Font to be approved, may have to use FONT from webste, Proxima Nova

9) "Adobe Illustrator Start Kit" spacing above is not uniform across all paragraphs, is that on purpose? Nope, fix

10) DESIGN: 
-- Plus cut for BG is width of container
-- Possibly replace my cuts with yours, I can provide the folder
-- Library icons possibly cut the same height and vertically centered to automatically handle spacing?
